Open issues updated over the last eight weeks: from [JHU CSSEGISandData
Github](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/)

## Truth data

We evaluate forecasts of cases and deaths against [Johns Hopkins
University data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), and we
recommend using this dataset as the basis for forecasts.

  - Daily numbers of cases and deaths are available to download from
    [JHU](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series),
    or from [our
    repository](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/data-truth).
  - JHU also provide [country
    metadata](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table.csv),
    including population counts and ISO-3 codes.

Note there are some differences between the format of the JHU data and
what we require in a forecast. Please check the
[Wiki](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/wiki/Targets-and-horizons#truth-data)
for more on forecast formatting.

#### Additional data sources

We do not use or evaluate against these data, but the following might be
useful for modelling targets:
