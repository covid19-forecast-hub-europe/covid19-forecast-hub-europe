## Truth data

### Cases and deaths

We evaluate forecasts of cases and deaths against [Johns Hopkins
University data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), and we
recommend using this dataset as the basis for forecasts.

  - Daily numbers of cases and deaths are available to download from
    [JHU](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series),
    or from [our
    repository](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/data-truth).
  - JHU also provide [country
    metadata](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table.csv),
    including population counts and ISO-3 codes.

Note there are some differences between the format of the JHU data and
what we require in a forecast. Please check the
[Wiki](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/wiki/Targets-and-horizons#truth-data)
for more on forecast formatting.

### Hospitalisations

We gather general hospital admissions data from various sources. See
separate [Hospitalisations
README](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/tree/main/code/auto_download/hospitalisations#readme).

Hospitalisation data can be difficult to produce and interpret, and is
not consistent across all the countries in the ECDC Forecast Hub. To
keep data and forecasts consistent, we include hospitalisations
forecasts for the following locations only:

  - Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece,
    Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta, Norway, Slovenia,
    Switzerland, United Kingdom

![Plot of truth data from different sources for all countries covered by
the forecast hub](plots/hospitalisations.svg)

The Hub validates and evaluates forecasts against the single dataset in
[ECDC/truth\_ECDC-Incident
Hospitalizations.csv](ECDC/truth_ECDC-Incident%20Hospitalizations.csv).
While we provide raw data files with multiple sources for
hospitalisation data in each location, this is for reference only to
cover daily as well as weekly data.

#### Additional data sources

We do not use or evaluate against these data, but the following might be
useful for modelling targets:
