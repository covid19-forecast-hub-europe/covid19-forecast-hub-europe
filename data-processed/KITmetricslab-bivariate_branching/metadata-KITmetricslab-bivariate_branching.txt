team_model_designation: primary
methods: Delta-variant and other cases are modelled as independent branching processes, with weekly growth\
  \ rates following random walks. Vaccination progress is currently not included.\
  \ Forecasts up to 4 wk are generated due to ensemble inclusion requirements, but 3 and 4 wk should be\
  \ interpreted with great caution.
team_funding: Helmholtz Innovation and Data Science Project "SIMCARD"
data_inputs: JHU (confirmed cases), RKI sequencing data (variants)
methods_long: "The total weekly incidence is modelled as the sum of two independent overdispersed branching\
  \ processes (delta / non-delta cases; may be updated to other pairs of variants later), with the weekly 
  \ growth rates following multiplicative random walks. Sequencing data are included via an additional binomial\
  \ observation process with the probabilities for the two variants proportional to their occurrence in the two
  \ latent branching processes. Posterior samples are enerated using the JAGS software. Priors were chosen as\
  \ 'uninformative' uniform distributions, but may be specified in a more informative fashion in the future.\
  \ In order to be included in the ensemble forecasts are generated up to 4 wk into the future, but given the\
  \ simple model structure, three and four-week-ahead forecasts should be interpreted with caution."
