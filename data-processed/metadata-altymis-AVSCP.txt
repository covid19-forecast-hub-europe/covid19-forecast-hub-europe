methods_long: "A method of calibrating the relationship between groups\
\ of phrases (values for phrases taken from Google Trends) regarding symptoms\
\ and searching for treatment and testing methods.\
\ The starting point was the number of cases in Poland on 2020-10-12.\ 
\ All subsequent values result only from conversions concerning\
\ the weight of the relationship between groups of phrases.\
\ In order to properly determine the burden on the health care\
\ system, a shift by 14-21 days should be taken into account -\ 
\ the numbers of cases "shift over time" due to various personal\
\ unpredictable parameters (treatment delay, problem in access to\
\ a doctor, fear of illness, etc.)\
