methods_long: "The main idea behind our agent-based model is a representation of the social structure of population of Poland to the level of individual citizen and its social contacts. Our model has resolution in space and contexts. It means it can follow development of epidemic on geographical grid in 1km resolution as well as through physical contact in various characteristic contexts of social life. We have representation of households, workplaces, kindergardens, schools, universities, travel, street and public places contacts in our model at the moment. Our approach allows prediction of potential ways of development of epidemics and exploration of various scenarios and effects of introduced administrative policies that adopt non pharmaceutical interventions."
