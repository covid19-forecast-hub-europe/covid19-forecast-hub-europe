For an initial, unobserved, seeding time infections were estimated using an exponential model with priors based on observed growth. For each subsequent time step, previous imputed infections were summed, weighted by an uncertain generation time probability mass function, and combined with an estimate of Rt to give the incidence at that time. The infection trajectories were then mapped to mean reported case counts by convolving over an uncertain incubation period and report delay distribution. Observed reported case counts were then assumed to be generated from a negative binomial observation model with overdispersion, multiplied by a day of the week effect with an independent parameter for each day of the week. Temporal variation was controlled using an approximate Gaussian process with a Matern 3/2 kernel. Rt was assumed to be constant over the forecast horizon although a correction was applied to adjust for the time-varying proportion of the population that was susceptible. Deaths were then modelled as a convolution of forecast cases combined with some scaling factor, a day of the week effect and a negative binomial observation model.",

Change 2020-10-29: The growth parameter can be thought of as the transmissibility of the virus in that state on that date and is a weighted regression between the  trend in the growth rate over the past 42 days and a growth rate that would keep the number of new daily confirmed cases constant. The weights of these two components are dynamically tuned to the observed data. To model new deaths in the population, we assume that a fraction of the 1,2,3,4, or 5-week moving average of the daily confirmed cases will die. The model learns both the moving average window and the case fatality fraction that best fits the historical observations."

The model incorporates transmission rate estimate dependence on mobility data and optimizes affected clusters' size to estimate all exposed individuals using the moving ascertainment rate estimate. To model deaths, we incorporated fixed time delay from positivity report to death estimated from data. Currently, we assume around 0.44% IFR, a simple division of the age structure 65+/65- is used. The model estimates continuously from the first outbreak (spring 2020), the prevalence corresponds to the Czech prevalence study from May 2020 as well as to December community test screenings. We incorporated dominance of b.1.1.7 at the beginning of the year 2021 by multiplying the transmission rate by 1.5 (the estimate is based on data that reveal evidence on its dependence on the number of risk contacts - study PAQ research https://zivotbehempandemie.cz/kontakty or mobility data).

This is an emperical approach that makes no epidemiological assumptions but simply fits the existing data as well as possible. The model assumes that the effects of current interventions are reflected in the observed data and that those effects will continue going forward."

Categories include hospitalized in regular wards (H) and in intensive care units (ICU), together with deceased (D) and recovered (R). These models explicitly formulate assumptions on the transition probabilities between these categories across time, thanks to a flexible formulation based on parameters that a-priori follow Normal distributions, possibly truncated to incorporate specific hypotheses having an epidemiological interpretation. The posterior distribution of model parameters and the transition matrices are estimated by an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that also provides predictions and allows us to compute the reproduction number Rt. All estimates and predictions are endowed with an accuracy measure obtained thanks to the Bayesian approach."

Our model can consider the effect of many complexities of the epidemic process and yet be simplified to a few parameters that are learned using fast linear regressions. Therefore, our approach can learn and generate forecasts extremely quickly. On a 2 core desktop machine, our approach takes only 3.18s to tune hyper-parameters, learn parameters and generate 100 days of forecasts of reported cases and deaths for all the states in the US. The total execution time for 184 countries is 11.83s and for more than 3000 US counties is 101.03s. Despite being fast, the accuracy of our forecasts is on par with the state-of-the-art as demonstrated on the leaderboard page. at https://scc-usc.github.io/ReCOVER-COVID-19. Our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends, and the variations in parameters during different times/policies allow us to forecast different scenarios such as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions."
