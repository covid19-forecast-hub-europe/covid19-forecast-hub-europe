team_model_designation: primary
methods: The Trend Model predicts daily cases and deaths using linear extrapolation
  on the linear or log scale of the underlying trend estimated by a robust LOESS seasonal-trend
  decomposition model.

methods_long: Our forecasts are based on the reported numbers of cases and deaths
  at the country or regional level. Our modeling substantially relies on estimation
  of the underlying trend by a robust LOESS seasonal-trend decomposition model, which
  allows to account for non-stationary weekly seasonality, outliers, missing data
  and delayed reports. To further predict daily cases and deaths we use linear extrapolation
  of the estimated smooth trend either on the original or on the logarithmic scale.
