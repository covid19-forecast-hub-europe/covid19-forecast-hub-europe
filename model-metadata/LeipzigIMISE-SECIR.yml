methods_long: We integrate an adapted mechanistic epidemiologic model of the SECIR
  type into Input-Output Non-Linear Dynamical Systems (IO-NLDS) serving as hidden
  layers, i.e. the true dynamics cannot directly be observed. Thereby, we include
  an asymptomatic compartment, a compartment of patients requiring intensive care,
  and subdivide most of the compartments into three sub-compartments to model time
  delays.  Changing factors of the system due to non-pharmaceutical interventions,
  changing age-structure of infected population, and changes in testing policy are
  imposed as inputs to the system. We then estimate parameters by a knowledge synthesis
  process considering parameter ranges derived from external studies and public data.
  Specifically, we use Bayesian inference for the parametersâ€™ estimation, which can
  also be time-dependent. Public data is translated to model outputs not identical
  but related to hidden states of the model. The model is fitted to data by a full
  information approach.
