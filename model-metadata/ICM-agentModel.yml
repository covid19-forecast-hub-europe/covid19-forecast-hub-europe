methods_long: The main idea behind our agent-based model is a representation of the
  social structure of population of Poland to the level of individual citizen and
  its social contacts. Our model has resolution in space and contexts. It means it
  can follow development of epidemic on geographical grid in 1x1km resolution as well
  as through physical contact in various characteristic contexts of social life.
