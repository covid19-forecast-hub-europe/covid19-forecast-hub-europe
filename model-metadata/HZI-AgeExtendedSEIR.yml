methods_long: This model is an extended SEIR model with additional compartments for
  the hospitalized, intensive unit, long-COVID, and death. The model is also developed
  as an age-structured model. The model is fitted to reported cases and reported cumulative
  deaths. The fitted parameters are used to predict the number of cases and deaths.
