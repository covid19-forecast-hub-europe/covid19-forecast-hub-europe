methods_long: Agent based model. Continuous time stochastic microsimulation on the
  base of census data for household composition , age distribution, working places
  etc.). Model includes contact tracing - classic and app based- , testing and quarantine
  . All relevant duration times like incubation time , time till hospitalization,
  time till testing are sampled fom distributions based on empirical data
