methods_long: 'This model makes predictions about the future, unconditional on particular  intervention
  strategies. The model consists of two processes. The first process  is a statistical
  model of how the  number of COVID-19 infections changes over time. The second process
  maps the number of  infections to the reported data. We model the growth of new
  cases as the product of a  dynamic growth parameter and the underlying numbers of
  susceptible and infected cases  in the population at the previous time step, scaled
  by the size of the state''s starting  susceptible population. Change 2020-10-29:
  The growth parameter can be thought of as the transmissibility of the virus in that
  state on that date and is a weighted regression between the   trend in the growth
  rate over the past 42 days and a growth rate that would keep  the number of new
  daily confirmed cases constant. The weights of these two components are dynamically
  tuned to the observed data. To model new deaths in the population, we assume that
  a fraction of the 1,2,3,4, or 5-week moving average of the daily  confirmed cases
  will die. The model learns both the moving average window and the case fatality
  fraction that best fits the historical observations.'
