methods_long: This model simulates SIR-dynamics with a log-normal convolutions  of
  infections to obtain the delayed reported cases. Parameters of the model are  sampled
  with Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo using the PyMC3 Python library. We assume that  the
  infection rate can change every week, with a standard deviation that is also an    optimized
  parameter. When new governmental restrictions are enacted or lifted, we    include
  a small prior to the change of the infection rate.
