methods: Compartmental model SUIHTER
methods_long: 'The results are obtained using the compartmental model SUIHTER which
  simulates the evolution of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. SUIHTER comprises the following
  compartments: Susceptibles(S), Undetected(U), Isolated(I), Hospitalized(H), Threatened(T),
  Extinct(E), Recovered(R). The model parameters are calibrated  thanks to a  combination
  of the least  squares  method  with the  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.
  The current version of the model accounts for two additional compartments collecting
  individuals who have received the first and the second dose of vaccine, respectively.
  Different NPIs and vaccination scenarios can be accounted for in the model forecast.'
