methods_long: Our model accounts for uncertainty via a Bayesian framework, for time-dependence
  on past COVID-19 counts via an INGARCH structure and non-linearity via time-varying
  coefficients. In addition, time-lagged NPI covariates have been coded and incorporated
  into the Bayesian framework to assess whether policy measures can effectively reduce
  positive counts.
