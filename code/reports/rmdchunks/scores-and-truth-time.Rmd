<!--- Forecasts diagnostics (WIS, overprediction, underprediction and sharpness)
over time. --->
## Scores over time (`r params$location_name`) {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Visualisation of the weighted interval score over time. In addition, the
components of the interval score, sharpness (how narrow are forecasts - smaller
is better), and penalties for underprediction and overprediction are shown.
Scores are again separated by forecast horizon.

```{r forecast-and-scores, results = "asis"}
src <- lapply(horizons, function(this_horizon) {
  knitr::knit_expand("template-scores-and-truth-time.Rmd")
})
res <- knitr::knit_child(text = unlist(src), quiet = TRUE)
cat(res, sep = '\n')
```
